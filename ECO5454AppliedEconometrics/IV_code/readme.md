I would like to see how vacancy rate of office building influences the sale transaction volume of office building in Florida from 2018 to 2021. I use the government's stay-at-home order during the pandemic as the instrument variable for office vacancy rate. The office data is from CoStar database, which is a popularly used commercial real estate database.
